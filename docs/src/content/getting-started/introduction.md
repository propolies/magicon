description: An end to end typesafe API for SvelteKit

## Install
```
npm i kavi zod
```

## What is Kavi?
Kavi makes it easy to create typesafe APIs in SvelteKit. SvelteKit unfortunately don't support typesafe APIs yet, which is why Kavi was created.

Kavi is an easy, simple and lightweight alternative to **tRPC-SvelteKit**. Kavi handles both `+page.server.ts`, `+page.ts` and `+page.svelte` files seamlessly.

The documentation is written with **svelte 5** but **svelte 4** is still supported for now.
